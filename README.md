Code to accompany epidemic dynamics review paper

Run the following scripts in `R` to reproduce the figures in the manuscript:

• The Alpha variant and the epidemiological importance of the reproduction number: `importance_of_R_versus_r_schematic.R`

• The complexity of herd immunity: the example of SARS-CoV-2: `herd_immunity.R`

• Schematic illustration of the relationship between the epidemic growth rate $r$, and the reproduction number $R$: `R_schematic.R`

• Estimating $R_t$ using renewal equation methods: `R_estimation.R` (first half)

• Reconstruction of events based on convoluted delayed outcomes: `R_estimation.R` (second half)
